I got CLIP files to process from https://github.com/miccunifi/SEARLE.git and also took help of https://github.com/miccunifi/SEARLE.git for the basic setup and pretrained models.

The CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model, developed by OpenAI, has revolutionized the field of vision and language by bridging the gap between textual and visual data. CLIP is trained on a large number of images paired with natural language descriptions, enabling it to understand the relationship between text and images without task-specific fine-tuning. This allows CLIP to perform a variety of tasks such as image classification, zero-shot image retrieval, and text-based image search, all while leveraging a shared embedding space for both images and text.

CLIP’s ability to generate shared embeddings for both images and texts enables it to perform well in zero-shot learning scenarios, where the model is tested on tasks it hasn’t explicitly been trained for. This makes CLIP highly applicable to domains requiring generalization across a wide range of tasks, such as image search, product matching, and multimodal content retrieval.

Overview of the Project
The iSEARLE project builds upon CLIP’s capabilities by addressing the challenge of zero-shot composed image retrieval. Traditional models often struggle with composed queries—text descriptions that contain multiple attributes, such as "red dress with floral patterns and lace trim." The iSEARLE framework enhances CLIP’s zero-shot retrieval performance by improving textual inversion techniques. Textual inversion refers to the process of learning a better representation of a text query, enabling the model to interpret more complex descriptions effectively.

The extension of iSEARLE i’ve developed adds several improvements to the original framework. It fine-tunes the zero-shot retrieval process and enhances the model's ability to handle real-world datasets, even when access to certain resources like CIRR is limited. This extension focuses on optimizing query flexibility, making it applicable to a wide range of e-commerce, content-based search, and personalized recommendation systems.CLIP for Product Matching (ACM): This paper demonstrates how CLIP can be used to match product images and textual descriptions for e-commerce platforms.

Zero-Shot Learning for Product Matching with CLIP (arXiv): The study explores how CLIP’s zero-shot learning capabilities can be applied to match products with textual queries, even without task-specific fine-tuning.
Product Retrieval with CLIP and Contrastive Learning (Springer): This paper focuses on improving product retrieval by using contrastive learning techniques in CLIP, allowing better matching between product images and descriptions.
These works provided insights into how CLIP can be used for image-text alignment in product catalogs, leading to the extension and improvement of the iSEARLE framework to handle more complex queries in real-world environments.
